# Beam Deflection Analyzer

A Python application to compute deflection and slope of I-shaped beams under various loads and boundary conditions using singularity functions.  
The application includes a PyQt5-based graphical interface and outputs shear force, bending moment, slope, and deflection diagrams.

## Features
- Point loads, distributed loads, and point moments
- Simply supported, fixed, and cantilever beams
- Calculates:
  - Support reactions
  - Bending moment and shear force diagrams
  - Beam slope and deflection diagrams
  - Symbolic equations using singularity functions

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/beam-deflection-analyzer.git
cd beam-deflection-analyzer
